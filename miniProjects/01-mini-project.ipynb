Make sure your code is neat, well-commented, and that all outputs are visible (run all cells before saving). Notebooks with missing tasks or unexecuted cells may receive fewer points. After you submit, you won’t be able to make changes, so double-check your work and be sure to start from the provided template\n\n## Submission rules\nAs already discussed in class, we will stick to the following rules.\n- Use the templates and name your files `NAME_SURNAME.ipynb` (If you have more than one name, just concatenate them). We will compare what you present with that file. \n- Code either not written in Python or not using PyTorch receives a grade of 0. Of course, you can use auxiliary packages when needed (`matplotlib`, `numpy`, ...), but for the learning part, you must use PyTorch.\n-  If plagiarism is suspected, TAs and I will thoroughly investigate the situation, and we will summon the student for a face-to-face clarification regarding certain answers they provided. In case of plagiarism, a score reduction will be applied to all the people involved, depending on their level of involvement.\n-  If extensive usage of AI tools is detected, we will summon the student for a face-to-face clarification regarding certain answers they provided. If the answers are not adequately supported with in-person answers, we will proceed to apply a penalty to the evaluation, ranging from 10% to 100%.",

This polynomial can also be expressed as the dot product of two vectors, namely\n$$p(z) = {x}{w}^T \\quad {x} = [1, z, z^2, z^3, z^4]$$\n\nConsider an independent and identically distributed (i.i.d.) dataset $\\mathcal{D} = \\{(z_i, y_i)\\}_{i = 1}^N$, where $y_i = p(z_i) + \\varepsilon_i$, and each $\\varepsilon_i$ is drawn from a normal distribution with mean zero and standard deviation $\\sigma$.\n\nNow, assuming that the vector ${w}$ is unknown, linear regression could estimate it using the dot-product form presented in the previous Equation. To achieve this, we can move to another dataset\n$$\\mathcal{D}' := \\{({x}_i, y_i)\\}_{i = 1}^N \\qquad {x}^i =  [1, z_i, z_i^2, z_i^3, z_i^4]$$\n\nThe task of this assignment is to perform polynomial regression using gradient descent with PyTorch.",
