    "## Traveling Salesperson Problem (TSP) – Heuristic with Transformers\n",
    "\n",
    "### Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "The Traveling Salesperson Problem (TSP) is a classical combinatorial optimization problem: given a set of cities and the distances between them, the goal is to find the shortest possible tour that visits each city exactly once and returns to the starting point. See this picture for reference. \n",
    "\n",
    "![TSP](https://optimization.cbe.cornell.edu/images/e/ea/48StatesTSP.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "TSP is NP-hard, meaning that finding the optimal solution becomes computationally intractable as the number of cities grows. Therefore, in practice, we often rely on heuristic or approximate algorithms to find good solutions in a reasonable time.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this assignment, your task is to implement a heuristic TSP solver for Euclidean TSP using a Transformer-based model. \n",
    "\n",
    "Euclidean TSP is a TSP where all the cities are assumed to be in the Euclidean 2D space and the distance is computed acording to the standard Euclidean norm.\n",
    "\n",
    "The Transformer architecture, widely used in natural language processing, can also model sequences of nodes in a graph. By training a Transformer on TSP instances, you can generate tours in an autoregressive manner selecting one city at a time based on previously chosen cities.\n",
    "\n",
    "This assignment will help you to understand how sequence models like Transformers can be applied beyond text, to combinatorial problems and practice autoregressive generation and masking techniques for sequence prediction.\n",
    "\n",
    "Most of the code is provided. This **does not mean that you are allowed to use it blindly**: make sure to understand what is happening."
